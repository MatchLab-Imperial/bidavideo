# SEA-RAFT
This repository contains the source code for our paper SEA-RAFT, which is a fast, simple, and effective framework for optical flow estimation. On [Spring](https://spring-benchmark.org/) benchmark, SEA-RAFT can process 1080p image pairs at >20FPS while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

## Requirements
Our code is developed with pytorch 2.2.0, CUDA 12.2 and python 3.10.
```Shell
conda create --name SEA-RAFT python=3.10.13
conda activate SEA-RAFT
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Zoo
Please download the models from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YLovlvUW94vciWvTyLf-p3uWscbOQRWW?usp=sharing) and put them into the `models` folder.

## Required Data
To evaluate/train SEA-RAFT, you will need to download the required datasets. 
* [FlyingChairs](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FlyingChairs.en.html#flyingchairs)
* [FlyingThings3D](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html)
* [Sintel](http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/)
* [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=flow)
* [HD1K](http://hci-benchmark.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/)
* [TartanAir](https://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset/)
* [Spring](https://spring-benchmark.org/)

By default `datasets.py` will search for the datasets in these locations. You can create symbolic links to wherever the datasets were downloaded in the `datasets` folder. Please check [RAFT](https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT) for more details.
